# 🏥 Healthcare Analytics Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end Healthcare Analytics Dashboard built using Python.
It analyzes patient demographics, disease trends, and hospital performance to
support data-driven healthcare decision-making.

----------

## Business Problem
Hospitals generate large volumes of patient data but lack actionable insights.
This dashboard helps administrators:
- Track key healthcare KPIs
- Understand disease patterns
- Optimize hospital resource utilization

----------

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains patient-level healthcare records including:
- Patient demographics (Age, Gender)
- Disease and outcome details
- Hospital and doctor information
- Treatment costs
- Admission & discharge dates

----------

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Plotly (Interactive Dashboards)
- Power BI (Optional Visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook
  
----------

## Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Converted date columns to datetime format
- Recalculated Length of Stay for accuracy
- Created Age Groups for demographic analysis
- Extracted admission month and year

----------

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Total Patients
- Total Revenue
- Average Billing Amount
- Average Length of Stay
- Number of Hospitals
- Number of Diseases

----------

## Dashboard Insights
- Middle-aged patients represent the largest admission group
- Chronic diseases such as Diabetes and Heart Disease dominate
- Average length of stay helps in capacity planning
- Disease trends support preventive healthcare planning

----------

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time database integration
- Predictive analytics for patient outcomes
- Streamlit web app deployment
- Advanced Power BI dashboards
